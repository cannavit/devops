# Requirements


These are the technologies involved:

> Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

[Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) (Amazon EKS) is a managed container service to run and scale Kubernetes applications in the cloud or on-premises.

> Kubernetes

[What is Kubernetes?](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/)
This page is an overview of Kubernetes.

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot. K8s as an abbreviation results from counting the eight letters between the "K" and the "s". Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014. Kubernetes combines over 15 years of Google's experience running production workloads at scale with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.


> Terraform

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs) is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently. This includes both low-level components like compute instances, storage, and networking, as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.

## Requirements

To create or maintain the infrastructure, it is recommended to have installed in the local environment:

- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/#helm)

?> **Tip** Use the helm version 1.23.0

- [kubectl client](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
